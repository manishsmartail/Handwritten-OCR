# Handwritten-OCR
Object detection Problem
Problem Statement: To recognize handwritten text from forms (with grids, e.g.- a bank form) and export as CSV file.
Collected data by scanning bank like forms. Used OpenCV to detect contours, Noise removal using Gaussian blur, dilate function to increase contour detection accuracy.We  have got 94% test accuracy on 50 classes.
